## Honors & Awards

**CCU AIT 5th Summer Camp Best Lecturer** `Accounting and Information Technology Faculty, National Chung Cheng University, 2016.7` 
Before I graduated, the Accounting students’ Guild invited me as a lecturer for the fifth accounting summer camp on July 10, 2016. It flattered me when I heard. I attached great importance to teaching high school students who are interested in accounting. Hence, I took a week to design my game - Fraud and Fraudit. It was an interactive game with audiences. Participants won credits by a group if they answered correctly. Then, all teams showed their financial statements and told a good story to gain the fund. Be careful! It may be a fraud! Candidates who acted as accountants must find out whether it was fraud. Call “BLUFF” when determining it was a scandal, then you won.<br>

**Excellent Teaching Assistant**
`Accounting and Information Technology Faculty, National Chung Cheng University, 2016.5` 

**KPMG Academic competition Champion Team**
`KPMG Taiwan, 2015.5`
KPMG International Limited (or simply KPMG) is a multinational professional services network, and one of the Big Four accounting organizations. Every June, they hold a KPMG academic competition in my university to reward those who have professional and practical knowledge. All candidates must answer the questions about intermediate accounting in a limited time. In the end, my team won the champion. It was thrill experience; I was glad that we showed teamwork and professionalism.
